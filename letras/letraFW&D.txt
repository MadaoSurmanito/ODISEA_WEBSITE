I've seen a little light
running through my head
I've heard a silent whisper
calling my name

I feel the energy 
immersed inside
I'm reincarnating  cause today 
i'm here to fight

All angels fly 
And all demons bite
Hear what I say
Cause it's the day

Fight, war and dreams
And I'll be, I'll be the only one
Effort and feelings
Cause I'll be, I'll be the only one
I'll be brave

I'm growing up and I
am learning next to you
Trying to differentiate
the evil from the good

You think I'm week, I'm less
and I'm easy to defeat
Let's see if you are able
to surpass the beast

Fight, war and dreams
And I'll be, I'll be the only one
Effort and feelings
Cause I'll be, I'll be the only one
I'll be brave

N, T
N, T, W, E
N, T
